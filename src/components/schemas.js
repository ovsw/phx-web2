Jimmy, Michael, and Ron (in no particular order) represent the epitome of professional. The home buying process is... well, just that, a process. As a Marine Corps myself, the �ice� was broken easily and we were able to get right down to business. Furthermore, the level of transparency this team operates with sets the bar high. Right up front we got to meet the team, discuss our concerns, and establish the expectations on both sides of the table. I apologize but I have forgotten the names of a couple other guys that we met that first day, and while I may not know what exactly they did, their diligence was felt as we �cruised� into home plate. I don\'t know if I could have picked a better crew to work with. Their patience is unparalleled, especially when I over-thought things and sent messages well after the close of business hour, and to get a response within a few minutes... I am/was impressed. For anyone reading this, if you are looking for: Honest, Transparent, Capable of translating the jargon, Willing to go above and beyond, I would highly recommend Jimmy V. and crew',

Your new loan could be for a better interest rate, a shorter/longer term, or a different amount. In fact, your new loan could be an entirely different type. For example, instead of an adjustable-rate mortgage you could opt for a fixed-rate mortgage.'
